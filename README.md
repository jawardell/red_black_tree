# Applications of  Red Black Trees

We implemented a who called system and managed a hypothetical school database. Red Black trees and other data structures were used in these two object oriented systems:

1. A flat-file database of school members was organized and accessed using a Red Black Tree and a Tree Map. 

2. A flat-file database of phone number listings was stored and searched over using a Red Black tree.
